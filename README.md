So what is this? It's a [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) workshop (shocking) and the first run is at [The Rich Web Experience](http://therichwebexperience.com/conference/fort_lauderdale/2012/11/home). The goal is simple: get people up to speed on Backbone. Here's the conference blurb:

You may have noticed today's web applications involve more than a few lines of JavaScript. You've probably also figured out JavaScript lacks certain...features...that make writing non-trivial applications more challenging. How do we resolve this conundrum? Luckily for us, we can leverage libraries like Backbone add some structure to our code. Backbone brings the concepts of the model view controller pattern we've applied to the server for years to the browser.

For those that are curious about *me*, here's my bio:
